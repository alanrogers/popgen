# Human Evolutionary Genetics

This repository contains materials for a course I taught from 2000 through 2024
under the title *Human Evolutionary Genetics*. I taught it first
on my own, then with Henry Harpending, and then (for years and years)
with Jon Seger. During the final semester, Jon and I taught it together with Angela Hancock. 
It was cross-listed at the University of Utah between
the Anthropology and Biology Departments under the designations Anth5221 and Biol5221.
