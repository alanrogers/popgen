A course on population genetics

This repository contains materials for a course I taught for many
years under the title *Human Evolutionary Genetics*. I taught it first
on my own, then with Henry Harpending, and then (for years and years)
with Jon Seger. It was cross-listed at the University of Utah between
the Anthropology and Biology Departments.
