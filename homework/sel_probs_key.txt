Here's a quick-and-dirty key to homework 5.

1. Plug the values into Gillespie's equation 3.3.

2. Plug into the formulas for w_1 and w_2, which are equal in this case to

  w_1 = 1 - qhs
  w_2 = 1 - phs - qs

3. Plug into G. 3.2 and 3.3 to get delta p, then calculate p' = p + delta
p.

4. Graph of delta p equals 0 at p=0, rises rapidly to a maximum value and
then falls gradually.  The maximum occurs at a value of p that is < 0.5.

5. Goes up, then down, then up again.  Equals zero at p=0, somewhere
in the middle, and at p=1.

6. Like the one above, but upside down.  Goes down, then up, then down
again.

7. Let p stand for the frequency of R.  In the first generation, p = 1
- sqrt(200/1000).  In the next generation, p' = 1 - sqrt(250/1000).
The problem assumes that w11 = w12 = 1, and w22 = 1-s.  With these
assumptions, wbar (bottom of p 61) is 1 - q^2 s, and the equation at
the top of p 62 becomes p' = p/(1-q^2 s).  You can solve this for s,
since we know p and p'.

8. With h=1/2, G 3.2 becomes delta p = pqs/(2 Wbar).  If pq ~= 1/4 and 
Wbar ~= 1, this becomes delta p ~= s/8.  In the graph, F goes from 0.4
to 0.6 in about 10 generations, so delta p ~= 0.06, and s ~= 1/2.
