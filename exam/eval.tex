Fall 2007
\end{center}
This is your chance to tell us what you thought of the course.  Don't
write your name, and we promise not even to look at them until the
grades are turned in.

This version of the course was experimental in several ways, and we
appreciate your patience with the rough edges.  We hope you liked it,
or at least got something out of it.  Whether you did or not, we want
to know.  Your feedback will help us plan next year's course.

  (c)~excessive, (d)~I have no basis for comparison.
\item How is the balance between population genetics theory and
  computing?  Should the next class have (a)~the same amount of both,
  (b)~more Python, less theory, (c)~more theory, less Python.
