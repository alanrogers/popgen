\subsubsection*{Python, probability, heterozygosity and selection}

\begin{exercise}
In a toss of two fair dice, one red and one black, what is the
probability of observing a red~4 \emph{and} a black~5?
\begin{answer}
$1/6 \times 1/6 = 1/36 \approx 0.028$
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
An urn contains 40 black balls and 60 red balls.  You choose a
ball at random, put it back, and choose another at random.  What are
the possible outcomes and their probabilities?
\begin{answer}
  There are two right answers. First, the student might choose to
  think in terms of ordered outcomes:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrr}
      Ball~1 & Ball~2 & Probability\\ \hline
      red    & red    & $\frac{6}{10} \times \frac{6}{10} = 0.36$\\
      red    & black  & $\frac{6}{10} \times \frac{4}{10} = 0.24$\\
      black  & red    & $\frac{6}{10} \times \frac{4}{10} = 0.24$\\
      black  & black  & $\frac{4}{10} \times \frac{4}{10} = 0.16$\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  Second, in terms of unordered outcomes:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rr}
      Pair  & Probability\\ \hline
      red/red    & $\frac{6}{10} \times \frac{6}{10} = 0.36$\\
      red/black  & $2 \times \frac{6}{10} \times \frac{4}{10} = 0.48$\\
      black/black  & $\frac{4}{10} \times \frac{4}{10} = 0.16$\\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  In the urn model of genetic drift, there are $2N$ balls in the urn
  of which a fraction $p$ are black.  Suppose we draw $2N$ balls from
  the urn with replacement.  Of the balls that we draw, a random
  number $X$ are black.  What are the \emph{mean} and \emph{variance}
  of $X$?  (Your answers should be in terms of $2N$ and $p$.)
\begin{answer}
$m=2Np$, $V=2Np(1-p)$
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\subsubsection*{Gene genealogies}

\begin{exercise}
  What is the hazard of a coalescent event within an interval
  containing 4 lines of descent (i.e. 4 ancestors of sampled gene
  copies) in a randomly-mating population of $N$ diploid individuals?
\begin{answer}
  \[
  h = \frac{4 \times 3}{4N} = 3/N
  \]
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  What is the expected depth of a gene genealogy (i.e.\ the expected
  age of the last common ancestor) for a sample of $K$ gene copies
  drawn at random from a randomly-mating population of $N$ diploid
  individuals?
  \begin{answer}
The expected depth of the gene genealogy is $4N(1-1/K)$ generations.
  \end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  What is the expected number of segregating sites in a sample of $K$
  gene copies? (Assume selective neutrality, constant population size,
  diploidy, and the model of infinite sites. Your answer should be in
  terms of two parameters, $\theta = 4Nu$ and $K$.)
\begin{answer}
\[
E[S] = \theta \{1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + \cdots + 1/(K-1)\}
\]
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\subsubsection*{Molecular evolution}

\begin{exercise}
Do we expect more adaptive evolution (fixations of advantageous
mutations) in large or in small populations, other things being equal?
Why?
\begin{answer}
We expect more in large populations, because the number if new
advantageous mutants is proportional to population size, but the
fixation probability for such mutants is essentially independent of
population size. The rate of adaptive evolution is thus proportional
to population size.

Some students may want to answer this question more formally, so here
is the formal version: let $u$ represent the mutation rate for
advantageous alleles whose fitness in heterozygotes is $1+s/2$,
relative to that of the wild-type allele. The number of such mutations
in the population as a whole is $2Nu$, and each of them has
probability $s$ of ultimate fixation. For this category of adaptive
mutations, the expected number fixed per generation is therefore
$2Nus$, an increasing function of population size.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Why do large populations tend to have more genetic variation than
  small ones?  (Answer in words, not in formulas.)
\begin{answer}
There are several ways to answer this question, including
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item drift is weaker in large populations;
\item in large populations, random pairs of gene copies are distantly
  related and therefore have deep genealogies, which allow lots of
  time for mutation;
\item there is more random inbreeding in small populations.
\end{inparaenum}
Accept anything that makes sense.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose a rare mutation increases the fitness of heterozygous
carriers---their fitness is 1.01 times that of wild-type
homozygotes. The fitness of homozygous mutants is 1.02 times that of
the wild type. What is the probability that this mutation will spread
to fixation? (Feel free to use the approximate formula rather than
Kimura's detailed version. If you use Kimura's version, then assume
$N$ is large.)
\begin{answer}
The mutation will fix with probability of roughly 0.02.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Consider the model of selection in Fig.~\ref{fig.overdom}. (a)~Which
values of $p$ are equilibria? (b)~Which of these equilibria are
stable?
\begin{answer}
There are three equilibria, at $p=0$, 0.4, and 1. The intermediate
equilibrium is stable, and the other two are unstable.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\caption{A model of selection. $\Delta_s p$ is the per-generation
  change in the frequency, $p$, of allele $A_1$. In other words, $p' =
p + \Delta_s p$, where $p$ is the allele frequency in one generation,
and $p'$ is that in the next. The allele is
increasing in frequency when $\Delta_s p > 0$ and decreasing when
$\Delta_s p < 0$.}

\subsubsection*{Multiple loci}

\begin{exercise}
\label{prob.2loc-xD}
In Gillespie's standard setup, there are four gamete types (or
haplotypes) $A_1B_1$, $A_1B_2$, $A_2B_1$, and $A_2B_2$, with
frequencies $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, and $x_4$.  Suppose that the gamete
types have frequencies $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (1/8, 3/8, 3/8, 1/8)$.
What is the value of $D$, the coefficient of linkage disequilibrium?
\begin{answer}
  \[
  D = x_1 x_4 - x_2 x_3 = 1/64 - 9/64 = -8/64 =  -1/8
  \]
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  In another population, suppose the recombination rate is $c=1/11$
  and that $D=1/10$ in generation~0.  What would $D$ be after 1
  generation? (Assume selective neutrality, random mating, and an
  infinite population.)
\begin{answer}
After 1 generation, $D = 1/11$.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Soon after a selective sweep has finished, \begin{inparaenum}[\it (a)]
\item what would you expect of nucleotide diversity at nearby loci?
  More diversity, less diversity, or about the same amount as before
  the sweep?
\item Is this effect larger or smaller in regions of low recombination?
\end{inparaenum}
\begin{answer}
(a)~Diversity should be lower at nearby loci. (b)~This effect is
larger in regions of low recombination.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\subsubsection*{Inbreeding and population structure}

\begin{exercise}
What is inbreeding depression and why is it thought to
occur?
\begin{answer}
  Inbred offspring are often smaller, less healthy, and lower in
  Darwinian fitness than their outbred counterparts. This is
  \emph{inbreeding depression}. It happens either because of fitness
  overdominance (heterozygote advantage) or because deleterious
  alleles tend to be recessive. Accept either answer.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\caption{Genealogy of George Darwin}
\label{fig.darwedge}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
Figure~\ref{fig.darwedge} shows the genealogy of George Darwin, one of
Charles and Emma Darwin's sons. What is his inbreeding coefficient?
\begin{answer}
$1/16$
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Suppose that a population consists of several subdivisions (or groups)
of equal size, within each of which mating is at random.  The mean of
group allele frequencies is 0.25 and their variance is 0.1875.  What is
the heterozygosity in the population as a whole? (Hint: use Wahlund's
formula.)
\begin{answer}
  The average heterozygosity is zero. The heterozygosity of a
  random-mating population with the same allele frequency would be
  $H_0 = 2 \times 0.25 \times (1 - 0.25) = 0.375$. By Wahlund's
  formula, the heterozygosity of the subdivided population is $H_0 -
  2V = 0$, where $V = 0.1875$ is the variance of group allele
  frequencies.
\end{answer}  
\end{exercise}  

\subsubsection*{Quantitative traits}

A selection experiment was undertaken using a population of outbred
plants.  Among unselected parents (i.e.\ the whole population), the
mean leaf length was 14~cm.  The mean was 18~cm among selected parents
and 17~cm among offspring.
\begin{exercise}
What was the selection differential ($S$)?
\begin{answer}
$S = 18 - 14 = 4$~cm.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What was the response ($R$) to selection?
\begin{answer}
$R = 17 - 14 = 3$~cm.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
What was the narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$)?
\begin{answer}
$h^2 = R/S = 3/4$.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The average bill depth of Geospiza fortis (Darwin's medium ground
finch) increased by 0.5~mm in one generation (1976 to 1978) in the
population on Isla Daphne Major that has been studied by Peter and
Rosemary Grant and their students and colleagues since the early
1970s. The phenotypic standard deviation of this trait is around 1~mm,
and its heritability has been estimated (from the correlations among
relatives) to be around $h^2 = 0.8$.

Given these numbers, what was the selection gradient $(\beta)$ during
the drought of 1977? (The drought was caused by a severe El Ni{\~ n}o
event that forced the birds to feed on large, hard seeds that they
otherwise wouldn't eat.)
\begin{answer}
The problem says that $h^2 = 0.8$ and that the phenotypic
standard deviation is $\sqrt{V_P} = 1$. This implies that $V_P=1$. The
problem also says that $h^2=0.8$. This implies that $V_A = h^2 V_P =
0.8$. Finally, the response to selection is $R = V_A \beta$, and we
know that $R=0.5$. Thus, $\beta = 0.5/0.8 = 0.625$.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Suppose that a trait is highly heritable within each of two
  populations and that the mean of the trait is different in the two
  populations. Does this imply that genetic factors account for a
  large fraction of the between-group difference? Why or why not?
\begin{answer}
  It does not. The difference between populations could be entirely
  environmental even if the within-group variance is entirely
  genetic. Or there could be gene-by-environment interaction.  (Accept
  either explanation.)
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Archaeologists and geneticists have argued for decades about what
happened during the Neolithic, as farming moved into Europe. Some
argued that the Neolithic was an invasion of farmers into regions
previously occupied by hunter-gatherers. Others argued that the
idea of farming spread, but not of the people themselves. According to
this view, the Neolithic spread as hunter-gathers learned from their
neighbors how to farm. In the past few years, DNA from ancient
skeletons has settled this debate. Summarize this evidence in a couple
of sentences.
\begin{answer}
Human remains from early Neolithic sites in Europe have DNA unlike
that of the hunter-gatherers who previously lived in the same
areas. The early farmers had DNA similar to that found today in
Sardinia and Corsica. This evidence shows that the Neolithic was an
invasion of farmers, not merely a movement of the idea of farming.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}

\section{Human evolutionary history}

\begin{exercise}
  Summarize (in a few sentences) the evidence for gene flow from
  archaic human populations into the modern populations of Eurasia.
\begin{answer}
As modern humans expanded out of Africa and across Eurasia, where was
some admixture with pre-existing archaic populations. It appears that
around 2\% of the DNA of modern Europeans derives from
Neanderthals. Similar levels are found throughout Eurasia. In
Melanesia, there is also appreciable admixture from a distinct archaic
population, the Denisovans.
\end{answer}
\end{exercise}
