# Python source code

This directory contains Python source code that I wrote for the lab section
of Human Evolutionary Genetics. The file `pgen.py` is a library containing
several utilities that are used in the lab. It is explained in the lab manual. 
Most of the other files are my own versions of the code students are supposed
to write in their lab projects. Incomplete versions of these programs are
included in the lab manual and are available online. There are also versions
in a directory under `lab`, which I make available to TAs.
