# Markdown source for the Lectures page of the website.

Files `index.md` and `islands.md` are in Markdown and are what you should
edit if you want to change anything. After editing, `make` will generate
new copies of `index.php` and `islands.html`. Then `make install` will
copy these into the website directory.
