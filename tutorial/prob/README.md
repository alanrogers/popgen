# Just Enough Probability

This directory contains the LaTeX source for a tutorial on
probability. The title is *Just Enough Probability*. To generate
a new version, run `latex main`, then `biber main`, then `latex
main`. You'll probably need to run `latex main` one final time
in order to resolve the cross references. This generates a file
called `main.pdf`, which you can rename and move where you want it.
