\section*{Preface}
This pamphlet is for students who need enough probability to get
through an undergraduate course on such subjects as population
genetics or ecology.  It assumes that readers are comfortable with
algebra.  There is a little calculus too, but it does not appear until
section~\ref{sec.continuousfun}, at the very end.
