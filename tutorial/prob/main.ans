There are many correct answers.  Here are two: (1)~Interpret numbers
as heads if less than 0.3 but as tails if greater.  (2)~Interpret
numbers as heads if between 0.2 and 0.5 but as tails otherwise.

The relative frequency of ``$RG \Or GG$'' is $2556/5000$, that of $RG$
is $1689/5000$, and that of $GG$ is $867/5000$.  The sum of the last
two is $1689/5000 + 867/5000 = 2556/5000$.
\ansno{1--4}
The relative frequency of the event $(A)$ that the first ball is red
equals $2445/5000$; that of the event $(B)$ that the second is green
equals $2556/5000$; that of event ``$A\Or B$'' is $(756+1689+867)/5000
= 3312/5000$.  The sum of the first two relative frequencies is
$2445/5000 + 2556/5000 = 5001/5000$, which is much larger than the
relative frequency of ``$A\Or B$.''
\ansno{1--5}
The first ball is red with probability $\Pr[A] = 1/2$, and the second
is green with probability $\Pr[B] = 1/2$.  The probability that both
events happened is $\Pr[A\And B] = 1/3$.  All this is from
Fig.~\ref{fig.tree}.  Using these values, the addition law gives
$\Pr[A\Or B] = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/3 = 2/3$.
\ansno{1--6}
 As shown on p.~\pageref{pg.Pr_green}, the tree diagram implies
that the unconditional probability of $B$ is $\Pr[B] = 1/2$.  On the
other hand, the conditional probability is $\Pr[B|A] = 2/3$.  These
probabilities are not equal, so $A$ and $B$ are not independent.
\ansno{1--7}
According to Table~\ref{tab.urn}, $\Pr[B]$ is estimated by $2556/5000
\approx 0.51$, and $\Pr[B|A]$ by $1689/2445 \approx 0.69$.  The two
numbers are only estimates, so we cannot conclude that the
probabilities differ merely because the estimates do.  However, the
difference between these estimates is large, and so is the sample.
Even without a careful statistical analysis, these results suggest
that the two balls were not statistically independent.
\ansno{1--8}
  The relative frequency of ``red 2'' is $3631/20,000 \approx 0.18$.
  This estimates the unconditional probability of rolling ``2'' with the
  red.  If we restrict attention to those trials on which the white die
  rolled ``4,'' the relative frequency of ``red 2'' is $535/2841 \approx
  0.19$.  This estimates the conditional probability of ``red 2'' given
  ``white 4.''  The numbers are pretty nearly equal, as they should be
  if the dice are statistically independent.

 Under sampling with replacement, the decision tree is as shown
below.

Using this decision tree, we can test for statistical independence as
follows: the second ball is green with unconditional probability
$\Pr[RG\Or GG] = 1/2$.  If the first ball is red, the second is green
with conditional probability $1/2$.  These numbers are the same, so
the two balls are statistically independent.
\ansno{2--1}
The sample space consists of all possible $(X,Y)$ pairs, where $X$ is
the number on the red die and $Y$ the number on the white.  $X$ and
$Y$ are both integers between 1 and 6, so there are 36 possible
outcomes.  If the dice are fair, then each outcome has probability
$1/36$.
\ansno{2--2}
The sample space is $\{0, 1, 2\}$.
\ansno{2--3}
The mean  is $5/3$, since there are 3 numbers that sum to 5.  Using
relative frequencies, the problem becomes
$1 \times  (2/3) + 3\times (1/3) = 2/3 + 3/3 = 5/3$.
\ansno{2--4}
\[
E[X^2] = (0\times 1/4) + (1\times 1/2) + (4\times 1/4) = 1.5

E[X + X^2]&=& ((0+0)\times 1/4) + ((1+1)\times 1/2)\\

\end{eqnarray*}
Compare this answer to that of the preceding exercise, and you will
see that $E[X + X^2] = E[X] + E[X^2]$.

$E[aX + bY^2] = aE[X] + bE[Y^2]$
\ansno{2--10}
First expand the squared term:
\[
E[(X + Y)^2] = E[X^2 + 2XY + Y^2]
\]
Next, use Eqn.~\ref{eq.E[X+Y]} to turn the expectation of a sum into a
sum of expectations:
\[
E[X^2 + 2XY + Y^2] = E[X^2] + E[2XY] + E[Y^2]
\]
Finally, re-express the middle term using
Eqns.~\ref{eq.E[aX]} and~\ref{eq.E[XY]}:
\[
E[X^2] + E[2XY] + E[Y^2] = E[X^2] + 2E[X]E[Y] + E[Y^2]
\]

The text used Eqn~\ref{eq.variance.a} to calculate that $m=10$ and
$V=2$.  For the other versions, we need relative frequencies: $f_8=1/4$,
$f_{10}=1/2$, and $f_{12}=1/4$.  Eqn.~\ref{eq.variance.b} gives
\begin{eqnarray*}
V&=&(1/4)(8-10)^2 + (1/2)(10-10)^2 \\
 && \mbox{} + (1/4)(12-10)^2\\
 &=& 1 + 0 + 1 = 2
\end{eqnarray*}
For the Eqn.~\ref{eq.variance.c}, we need
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum x^2 f_x &=& 8^2/4 +10^2/2 + 12^2/4\\
 &=& 16 + 50 + 36 = 102
\end{eqnarray*}
We also need $m^2 = 10^2 = 100$.  Subtracting gives $V = 102 - 100 =
2$.

The mean is
\[
E[X] = 0 \times 1/3 + 1\times 1/2 + 2 \times 1/6 = 0.833.

The variance is

V[X] &=& (0-0.833)^2 \times 1/3\\
&&\mbox{} + (1-0.833)^2\times 1/2\\
&&\mbox{} + (2-0.833)^2 \times 1/6\\
&=& 0.472.

\ansno{2--14}
%
In the data, the relative frequencies are $f_8=1/4$, $f_{10} = 2/4$,
and $f_{12} = 1/4$.  The mean is $10$.  According to Eqn.~\ref{eq.V3},
the variance is
\begin{eqnarray*}
V &=& (1/4)\times 8\times(8-10)\\
 &&\mbox{} + (1/2)\times 10\times (10-10)\\
 &&\mbox{} + (1/4)\times 12\times (12-10)\\
 &=& (1/4)\times (-16)\\
 &&\mbox{} + (1/2)\times 0\\
 &&\mbox{} + (1/4)\times 24\\
 &=& -4 + 6 = 2\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\ansno{2--15}
First, $E[aX] = aE[X]$ by equation~\ref{eq.E[aX]}.  Next,
\begin{eqnarray*}
V[aX] &=& E[(aX - aE[x])^2]\\
 &=& E[a^2(X - E[x])^2]\\
 &=& a^2E[(X - E[x])^2] \qquad \hbox{using (\ref{eq.E[aX]}) again}\\
 &=& a^2 V[X]
\end{eqnarray*}
\ansno{2--16}
 With the new probabilities, we expect fewer $(0,0)$ and
  $(1,1)$ pairs but more $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$.  There is still a
  tendency for $X$ and $Y$ to vary in the same direction, but that
  tendency is weaker.  In other words, the relationship is weaker but
  still positive.  The covariance turns out to be $C[X,Y] = 0.05$.
\ansno{2--17}
One way is to replace the $P_{XY}$ values in Table~\ref{tab.bivdist}
with 0.1, 0.4, 0.4, and 0.1.  This yields $C[X,Y] = -0.15$.
\ansno{2--18}
The corresponding formulas are
\begin{eqnarray}
C[X,Y] &=& N^{-1} \sum_i (x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)\label{eq.cov.a}\\
  &=& \sum_{x,y} (x-\bar x)(y-\bar y) f_{xy}\label{eq.cov.b}\\
  &=& \sum_{x,y} xy f_{xy} - \bar x\bar y\label{eq.cov.c}
\end{eqnarray}
where $f_{xy}$ is the frequency of $(X,Y)$ pairs in the data for
which $X=x$ and $Y=y$.  Using any of these formulas, the given data
imply that $C[X,Y] = 0.0833$.
\ansno{3--1}
The sample space is $\{0, 1, 2\}$; the corresponding probabilities
are $1/4$, $1/2$, and $1/4$.
\ansno{3--2}
The allele disappears with probability
\[
P_0 = \binom{2000}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{2000} \approx 0.135
\]
In this calculation, there is no need to calculate $\binom{2000}{0}$;
it must equal 1 because there is only 1 way to choose 0 of something.
In addition, $p^0 = 1$ because \emph{anything} raised to the zeroth
power equals 1.  The only part that needs calculating is
$(1-p)^{2000}$.
\ansno{3--3}
For the Bernoulli distribution, there is only one event.
Consequently, $N=1$ and Eqn.~\ref{eq.binomial} becomes
\[
P_x = \frac{1!}{1! \times 0!} p^x (1-p)^{1-x}
\]
Recall that $0! = 1! = 1$.  (See appendix~\ref{sec.factorial} for
details.)  Consequently, $1!/(1! \times 0!) = 1$ and drops out of the
equation.  If $x=0$, then $p^x = p^0=1$, and this term drops out.
Eqn.~\ref{eq.binomial} becomes $P_0 = 1-p$.  On the other hand, if
$x=1$, then $(1-p)^{1-x} = (1-p)^0 = 1$ and drops out.  We are then
left with $P_1 = p$.
\ansno{3--4}
$E[X] = 1/2$ and $V[X] = 1/4$.
\ansno{3--5}
Since $A_1$ has frequency $p$, that is also the probability that we
have drawn a copy of this allele.  It follows that $E[X] = p$ and
$V[X] = p(1-p)$.
\ansno{3--6}
 For $x=2$ and $\lambda = 0.61$, the Poisson formula gives $P_2
= 0.101$.  We therefore expect to see about $0.101\times 200 = 20.2$
corps-years with 2 mule-kick deaths.  This is close to the real number
of 22.
\ansno{3--7}
The probability of no mutation is
$P_0 = e^{-2} \approx 0.135$.
Note that this answer is identical to that of the preceding exercise.
This illustrates the fact that, when $N$ is large and $p$ is small,
the Poisson is a good approximation to the binomial.
\ansno{3--8}
The probability of ``at least one mutation'' is $\Pr[X>0]$.
There are two ways to think about this problem. The hard way sums
across all non-zero entries of the Poisson distribution:
\[
\Pr[X>0] = \sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}
\]
As I said, that is the hard way and is not recommended. The easy
solution proceeds from the observation that all probability
distributions sum to~1. For a non-negative random variable such as the
Poisson, this implies that $\Pr[X=0] + \Pr[X>0] = 1$. Thus,
\[
\Pr[X>0] = 1 - \Pr[X=0] = 1 -e^{-\lambda}
\]
In the current question, $\lambda=2$, so $\Pr[X>0] \approx 0.865$.

The area of the shaded rectangle is $(0.3-0.2) \times 1 = 0.1$.  This
is also the probability that $0.2 < X < 0.3$.
\ansno{3--10}
For any continuous r.v., the probability that $X$ lies between two
values $a$ and $b$ is $\int_a^b f(x) dx$.  In this problem, $a=0.2$,
$b=0.3$, and $f(x)=1$.  The integral is thus equal to 0.1.

An exponential variable is $<1$ with probability

 100~years, because the mean is $1/h$, and the problem says
