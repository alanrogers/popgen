  <h1>Biol5221: Extra credit algebra assignment</h1>
<p>The assignment requires that you do the same set of exercises
  twice, timing yourself both times. The exercises are
  in <a href="protected/simmons.pdf"> this</a> pdf document. Your copy
  should include pages 36-49 and 63-65, but <em>not</em> 50-62.
  Fragments of sections at the beginnings and ends of the scanned
  portions are <em>EXCLUDED</em> from the assignment.  Specifically,
<ul>
<li> Omit question 1, at the top of page 36.</li>
<li> Omit section 1.9 (Inequalities and Absolute Values), which begins at
  the bottom of page 49.</li>
<li> Omit questions 25-27, at the top of page 63.</li>
<li> Omit section 3.2 (Division of Polynomials), which begins at the
  bottom of page 65.</li>
</ul>
The rest of the document is included in the assignment.
</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read through the document.  
<li>Do the exercises, timing yourself as you go.  I want to know how
  long it took to do the entire set of exercises, not each section or
  each individual problem.  
<li>Do the previous step a second time, timing it once again.</li>
</li>
</ol>
Turn in both sets of exercises, together with your timings. Please
write the answers on your own paper, and put a summary of the timings
at the top of page 1.

<h2>How we use this assignment in calculating grades</h2>
<p>
Those who turn in a fully-completed assignment will receive the extra
points listed in the syllabus. This credit is added <em>after</em> the
<a href="grading.php">curve</a>, so that students can get a perfect
score (100%) without doing the extra credit assignment.
