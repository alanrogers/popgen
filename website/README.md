# Website directory

This directory tree contains the material for the course website, which is
hosted by a University server. When I've changed the website in this
directory, I use `rsync` to copy it to the University server. See the top-level
`README.md` and `Makefile`.

The directories `unprotected` and `protected` contain readings. The first
of these contains readings with no copyright, mainly stuff I wrote. The
second contains copyrighted material that should be accessible only to students
and therefore requires a username and password. Because I'm now about to
make the entire course website public, I've deleted all the copyrighted files.
All links to those files will therefore be broken.
